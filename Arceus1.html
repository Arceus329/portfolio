      <p>   I like pokemon and gacha life. Also, I enjoy watching youtube. Some of my favorite youtubers are: Funneh, Sis vs Bro, Collins Key (and Devan Key), Wengie, and Gaming Therorists (please watch them, espically gaming therorist, because MatPat uses MATH to solve gaming theories). I love to draw Gacha life and scary things. I like editing photos and make them interesting. </p>
      <h3> Pet Peeves: </h3>
      <p>   Even though I like drawing scary things, I hate riddles and scary videos/movies. I hate my sister doing annoying stuff like sitting on my bed. I also hate it when I can't watch any recent pokemon movies because I am a huge fan of Pokemon.
